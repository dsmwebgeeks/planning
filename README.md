###Meeting notes on next six months:

We planned our Dojos for the next six months (the schedule is below), and decided to make an attempt at finding a more permanent lunch talk location. Matt should speak with Gravitate about using their space and Justin should talk with BusineSolver to use their space. We each will be investigating UI prototyping apps in preparation for our next Dojo.

Here is the schedule we agreed to for the next six months:

    description: 'Attempt to create a functional mockup using UI prototyping tools and common practices. Each group will be challenged to illustrate some interactive functionality of a mockup. Groups will choose between using InVision, Pingendo, or Google Slides.',
    event preparation:
        - Josh: Investigate InVision http://www.invisionapp.com/ and be prepared to demo it's functionality.
        - Justin: Investigate Pingendo http://pingendo.com/ and be prepared to demo it's functionality. Find example mockups to use during the Dojo. Draft blog post.
